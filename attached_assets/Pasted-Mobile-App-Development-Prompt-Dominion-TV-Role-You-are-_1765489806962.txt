Mobile App Development Prompt: Dominion TV

Role: You are an expert React Native developer using Expo.
Project Goal: Build a functional MVP for a broadcasting station's mobile app called "Dominion TV".
Tech Stack: React Native (Expo), Javascript, firebase
1. Design System & Branding

App Name: Dominion TV

Primary Color: Bright Turquoise (#08D9D6) - Used for active tabs, buttons, and headers.

Secondary Color: Red - Used for "LIVE" status borders and badges.

Background: White/Clean minimalist layout.

Typography: System default (San Francisco/Roboto), clean and legible.

2. Core Navigation Structure

Create a Custom Bottom Tab Bar (do not use react-navigation) with three tabs:

Home (Default): Displays the Program Schedule.

News: Displays a list of news headlines.

Settings: Displays app preferences and "About" info.

3. Screen 1: Home (Program Schedule)

Header: Fixed top header with the text "DOMINION TV" in the primary color.

Content: A vertical scrollable list of program cards.

Card Design:

Left: A square thumbnail placeholder (gray bg with TV emoji).

Middle: Title (Bold), Host Name (Grey), Time Slot (Primary Color).

Right: A circular "Play" button.

"LIVE" Logic:

The app must check the user's current device time against the schedule.

If a show is currently airing, the card must have a Red "LIVE" badge and a Gold border.

Action: Clicking "Play" on a LIVE show opens the station's YouTube Channel URL.

Action: Clicking "Play" on a NON-LIVE show opens a YouTube search for that specific program's title.

4. Screen 2: News

Header: "NEWS"

Content: A list of mock news items (Title, Time ago, Image placeholder).

Interaction: Clicking a news item currently does nothing (placeholder).

5. Screen 3: Settings

Header: "SETTINGS"

Content:

A "Push Notifications" toggle switch (visual only).

An "About" section showing the app version.

6. Data Source (Hardcoded Schedule)

07:00 - 08:50: DAYBREAK LIVE
